# 5 Convex Analysis
## 5.1 Convex Sets
A *convex set* is a set $K \subseteq \mathbb R^N$ where for all $x, z \in K$ and all $t \in [0, 1]$, $tx + (1-t)z \in K$. By induction, it follows that all convex combinations of several elements in the set are also in the set.

The *convex hull* $\text{conv}(T)$ of a set $T$ is the smallest convex set containing $T$, or equivalently the set of all convex combinations of elements from $T$.

### Cones
A set $K\subseteq \mathbb R^N$ is called a *cone* if for all $x \in K$ and all $t \geq 0$, $tx$ is contained in $K$. A cone that is convex is called *convex cone*, and $K$ is a convex cone iff for all $x, z \in K$ and $t, s \geq 0$, also $sx +tz \in K$.
- for example, the set of positive semidefinite matrices in $\mathbb R$
- or the *positive orthant* $\mathbb R_+^N = \{x \mid x_i \geq 0 \forall i \in [N] \}$

##### Dual Cones
For a cone $K$, its dual cone $K^\ast$ is defined as
$$K^\ast = \{ z \in \mathbb R^N : \langle x, z \rangle \geq 0 ~~ \forall x \in K\}$$
- $K^\ast$ is closed and convex (as intersection of half-spaces), and furthermore again a cone.
- If $K$ is a closed cone, then $K^{\ast\ast} = K$.
- If $H, K$ are cones and $H \subseteq K$, then $K^\ast \subseteq H^\ast$

For example, the positive orthant is self-dual.

##### Polar Cones
Given a cone $K$, the polar cone is defined as
$$K^\circ = \{ z \in \mathbb R^N \mid \langle x, z \rangle \leq 0 ~~\forall x \in K \} = -K^\ast$$
##### Conic Hull
The *conic hull* $\text{cone}(T)$ of a set $T$ is the smallest convex cone containing $T$, or equivalently the set of all conic combinations of elements from $T$, i.e. $$\text{cone}(T) = \left\{ \sum_j t_j x_j : t_j \geq 0, x_j \in T \right\}$$
### Geometric Hahn-Banach Theorem
Hahn-Banach: "Non-overlapping convex sets can be separated by hyperplanes".

> **Theorem 14.4** (*Finite-dimensional Hahn-Banach Theorem*)
> Let $K_1, K_2 \subseteq \mathbb R^N$ be convex sets with disjoint interiors. Then there exist $w, \lambda$ such that
> $$K_1 \subseteq \{ x \in \mathbb R^N \mid \langle x, w \rangle \leq \lambda \}, \quad K_2 \subseteq \{ x \in \mathbb R^N \mid \langle x, w \rangle \geq \lambda \}.$$

### Extreme Points
Let $K \subseteq \mathbb R^N$ be a convex set. A point $x \in K$ is called *extreme point* of $K$ if the only way to represent $x$ as convex combination $x = tw + (1-t)z$ for $w, z \in K$, $t \in (0, 1)$ is by choosing $x = w = z$. Note: this is *not* the same as the boundary (e.g. for a convex polygon, only the corners are extreme points, not all points on the boundary)

> **Theorem 14.6**
> A compact convex set is the convex hull of its extreme points.
